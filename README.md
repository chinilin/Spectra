# Spectra
Spectral preprocessing methods, first and second
derivatives (FD and SD), standard normal variate (SNV), multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), and continuum removal (CR) were employed after smoothing with Savitzky-Golay to improve the robustness and performance of the calibration models. According to the criteria of maximal coefficient of determination (R2cv) and minimal root mean square error of prediction in cross-validation (RMSEPcv), the PLSR algorithm with FD preprocessing was determined as the best method for predicting soil organic carbon.Overall, this study indicated that the Vis-NIR reflectance spectroscopy technique combined with a continuously enriched soil spectral library as well as a suitable preprocessing method could be a nondestructive alternative for monitoring of the soil environment.
